## About Me

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk), co-supervised by [Dr. Clara Cheung](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/clara.cheung), [Dr. Akilu Yunusa-Kaltungo](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/akilu.kaltungo), and [Dr. Wei Pan](https://panweihit.github.io). My study is generously funded by University of Manchester Bicentenary Scholarship.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-technologies-research-development-uk-ltd/mycompany/">Huawei Noah's Ark Lab</a> in London, working on AI agent research. Before this, I obtained my Master's degree in Robotics and Computation from <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a> in 2024 and a Bachelor's degree in Automation from <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn">Beihang University</a> in 2023.

I am always open to collaboration and exciting research opportunities, and I am excited about working on cutting-edge research in industry.

## Research Interests

I'm mainly interested in reinforcement learning, embodied intelligence, and AI agent.
